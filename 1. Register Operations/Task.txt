1 – Load the number 123 to R9. Move this value to R7.
2 – Load the number 0x4400 to R5. Load the number 99 to R6. Store the contents of R6 to the memory at the address in R5.
3 – Continuing from 2, load the contents of the memory at the address 0x4400 to R5.
4 – Starting from the address 0x4400, store the numbers 11, 22, 33, 44 to the memory as bytes. Mind the endian ordering.
5 – Continuing from 4, add the numbers stored to the memory and store the result in R6.
