1 – Using assembler directives, create an array in the memory, and initialize it with the numbers below (use .word):
9712, 2454, 1275, 3312, 4243, 2395, 4387, 12236, 9454, 32221
2 – Find the number of elements that are greater than 10000 in the array created in step 1 and store the result in R9.
3 – Create a 20 byte-long uninitialized section in the memory (use .bss).
4 – Fill the buffer created in step 3 with even numbers starting from 2. Numbers will be stored as words.
