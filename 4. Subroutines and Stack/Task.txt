Suppose we want to implement an addition function to perform the following: c=a+b
The terms (a,b) are to be passed by value. The sum (c) is to be passed by reference. This can be implemented in C as such:
void addition(int a, int b, int* c)
{
*c = a + b;
}

Implement this in ARM assembly as a subroutine, and use it to add two numbers.
* (a,b,c) are word-sized.
* Your subroutine should not change register or memory contents (except for c).
* Upon returning from the subroutine, SP should remain unchanged.
* All arguments are passed by stack.
